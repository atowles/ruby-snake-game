# snake/pacman
A mix between the classic snake and pacman games, written in ruby

First download the files: ```git clone https://github.com/atowles/ruby-snake-pacman.git```

Change directories to the game: ```cd ruby-snake-pacman/bugg```

Make the game runnable: ```chmod +x main.rb```


After these steps you should be able to play the game just by running ```./main.rb```



If you don't have these packages already, you may have to install [python3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-python-on-linux/), [python-tk](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-tkinter-on-linux/), [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), and [ruby2d](https://www.ruby2d.com/learn/linux/#install-packages)

###### Note: after installing the various SDL packages for linux, on any operating system, you will have to run ```gem install ruby2d```
